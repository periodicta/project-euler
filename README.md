# project-euler
This repository contains my code (Python) solutions for the problems that I have solved. As per Project Euler's rules, only code for the first 100 projects will be published here.

**Disclaimer**: Please ONLY look at this code IF YOU HAVE FINISHED THE PROBLEM ALREADY. To run this code and solve the puzzles without putting in any effort only cheats yourself; all you do is rob yourself of the joy of problem solving without gaining any actual knowledge of problem solving skills. This repository is PURELY for those who have already completed the puzzles and wish to take a look at a different methodology.

Project Euler, for those curious, can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/)
